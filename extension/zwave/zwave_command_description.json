If implementing this command class, it is RECOMMENDED that the Notification Command Class, version 3-8 is also implemented. The Binary Sensor Command Class is used to realize binary sensors, such as movement sensors and door/window sensors. Version 2 of this command class is extended with the following functionalities: • A “get-supported” mechanism for the controlling device to interview the binary sensor for its supported sensor types   \n• A list of defined sensor types capable of reporting a binary value NOTE: A binary sensor is defined as a sensor unit capable of providing a binary value in the report i.e. that an event was “triggered” or “not triggered” and not other intermediate values. For sensor units providing multiple values the Multilevel Sensor Command Class is more suitable. The Binary Sensor Command Class can further advance through implementation of the Notification Command Class to communicate details about the event. ",

If implementing this command class, it is RECOMMENDED that the Schedule Command Class, version 1 is also implemented. The Climate Control Schedule Command Class allows devices to exchange schedules and overrides, which specify when to perform a setback on the setpoint. Note: The setpoint is the temperature a device will try to maintain. The setback is a deviation from the setpoint. When a setback is in use the device will apply the setback to the setpoint, resulting in a different temperature. When using schedules and overrides it is possible to define several setbacks occurring at specific times. Schedules are exchanged using the Schedule Commands. Overrides of schedules are exchanged using the Schedule Override Commands. Detection of updated schedules is done using the Schedule Changed Commands. The Climate Control Schedule uses the Schedule State type to define each setback. The Schedule State type has the following format: ",

A parameter may be advertised as “advanced” to indicate to the controlling application that the actual parameter is intended only for advanced use, e.g. calibration.

The DCP Configuration commands are separated for the DCP monitoring commands in the Demand Control Plan Monitor Command Class, allowing the classes to be optionally supported at different security levels. (E.g. DCP monitoring commands could be supported using non-secure communication, while enabling strict secure-only communication for the DCP Configuration Command Class). Refer to the Security and Security 2 command classes for more details. A DCP event contains information regarding criticality, products involved, requested reduction, time duration and if a certain rate (identified by a Demand Control Plan Rate ID, refer to the Rate Table Configuration Command Class) is associated with the event. When a DCP event is outdated, it is removed from the list. It is the utility supplier responsibility to prevent overflow of the list by query the number of free positions in the list before submitting a new DCP event to the list. Each DCP event is uniquely identified by a timestamp issued the Utility Supplier. A DCP event may also include information, which enables devices not supporting this class to use in the Demand Control Plan through the Start & Stop Association Group functionality. The installer, the end user or Utility Supplier (remote management) configures the Association groups. During the configuration process the devices are selected and the association entries are created. These associations can additionally be configured with the specific Z-Wave commands (through the Association Command Configuration Command Class). If no Z-Wave commands are specified in the Associations groups, it is the responsibility of the device to issue the relevant commands based on Utility Supplier specific algorithms. ",

Therefore, it is OPTIONAL for a version 8 node to comply with Table 2.425 when receiving a V2 Get Command. Version 8 of this Command Class introduces additional Notifications (refer to [36]). Version 8 increases the requirement level for the use of the “State idle” Notification from OPTIONAL to REQUIRED. Supporting nodes implementing version 8 or newer of the Notification Command Class MUST issue a “State idle” Notification when a state variable returns to idle. For instance, the {Smoke alarm::Smoke Detected} Notification MUST be followed by a {Smoke alarm::State idle(Smoke detected)} Notification when the smoke is no longer detected by the sensor.

The Sensor Configuration Command Class adds the possibility for sensors to act on either a measured value or on a preconfigured value. With this command class an application can act on a specific event. It is up to the application to implement the actual event. This could e.g. be implementation of the Association Command Class where the application would activate a group based on a trigger from the sensor. The trigger types that may be configured are the same types as the values specified in the Multilevel Sensor Command Class Most movement sensors may be configured to “ignore” movement if it is not dark. Typically this is done manually. With the Sensor Configuration Command Class this may be configured remotely in a standardised way. A device supporting the Sensor Configuration Command Class may be configured via the trigger level, but the decision on what the level change should trigger is up to the application. For the movement sensor this trigger level could be an input parameter to the logic that controls the light. ",

Therefore, this Command Class definition MAY be updated in a non-backwards compatible manner, or even removed. Consult with the Z-Wave Alliance Application Work Group if you consider implementing this Command Class. The User Credential Command Class is used to manage user Credentials for gaining access to properties, typically through unlocking or opening doors. Those properties could be residential or commercial. Credential types include PIN Codes, Passwords, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Near Field Communication (NFC), Ultra-Wideband (UWB), and Biometrics. This command class employs a user-centric model, allowing multiple Credentials to be associated with one User Unique Identifier. Setting schedules for User Unique Identifiers is not required. However, if setting schedules for Unique User Identifiers is supported, then they MUST be supported using the Schedule Entry Lock Command Class, version 4 [NEVER CERTIFIED] or higher. To prompt notifications based on activity for these User Unique Identifiers/Credentials, the Notification Command Class MUST be used. When a node is first enrolled in a Z-Wave network, the controlling device SHOULD query the node for any existing User/Credential information before setting up new User Unique Identifiers. It is possible that nodes have already been populated with desired User Unique Identifiers before network inclusion using some other home automation technology or using a local interface. ",

For example, a biometric credential might be added directly to a lock using a lock’s local interface. Those limited local interfaces can make it challenging to associate the newly added biometric credential with an already existing user, and as a result the lock may create a new user entry for the credential. That user may later want to use an interface on their controller to move that biometric credential over to a previously existing user (that may have been programmed through the controller, and have existing credentials like an RFID card and a PIN Code). They can use this command to accomplish that goal. At the end of this process, the credential will no longer be associated with its starting user. A node receiving this command MUST respond by sending a User Unique Identifier Credential Association Report Command. This command MUST NOT be issued via multicast addressing. A receiving node MUST NOT return a response if this command is received via multicast addressing. The Z-Wave Multicast frame, the broadcast Node ID and the Multi Channel Multi-End Point destination are all considered multicast addressing methods.

The device MUST implement the Association Command Class as ‘supported’ The Association Command Class and the Command Configuration Command Class MUST be linked through the following dependencies: • Nodes added to an association through an Association Set or Association Composite Set MUST be reported in Command Configuration Reports with the Command Class and command identifiers transmitted to the nodes.   \n• Nodes added to an association through a Command Configuration Set MUST also be reported in an Association Report and Association Composite Report   \n• All commands associated to a grouping identifier/NodeID pair will be removed as a result of an Association Remove. The related command records will be released   \n• Command(s) associated to a grouping identifier/NodeID/endpoint pair will be removed as a result of an Association Composite remove. The related command(s) record will be released. The memory consumption of supporting full command sizes in all combinations of groupings identifiers and Node IDs is very extensive; hence the command class supports a memory flexible implementation. The Command Class allows a device to support a number of command records. A command record consists of the grouping identifier, the Node ID and the command. The size of the command MAY be restricted by the device through the Max command length field. The command MUST be the complete command needed (I.e. All relevant encapsulations MUST be included in the command). When no command records are free (all has been used), new commands MUST NOT be allocated to Node IDs before one or more command records have been freed up (through the Association Remove Command) If the 2nd node runs out of free command records before it has finalized its command configurations, it MUST accept that the application on the device has full control of the remaining Node IDs. Alternatively the 2nd node can abort the command configuration process. In this case it is RECOMMENDED that the 2nd node free up the used command records in the aborted command configuration attempt. A device can report the maximum number of command records, the number of free command records, and the max command length supported through the Command Records Supported Report. In order to support sharing knowledge of how a device controls nodes without using extensive memory resources a Configurable Cmd field is supported. When configurable Cmd= 0x0 then a 2nd node can only monitor the commands. It cannot control them. The V/C field allows a device to decrease the memory utilization to a minimum. When a device reports V/C=0x01, then the Command Configuration Set and Command Configuration Report MUST always use command class identifier and command identifier equal to a Basic Set Command Records Supported Get. This allows the device to only store the value field and thereby save memory resources. ",

Examples of such setup operations could be Z-Wave Plus Lifeline configuration or Security 2 bootstrapping. If the S2 bootstrapping is handled by a SIS after the Z-Wave network inclusion has been handled by an inclusion controller, the joining node will detect two different NodeIDs for Network inclusion and S2 bootstrapping. The NodeID of the including controller is not relevant for the authentication of the joining node. Therefore, the joining node MUST NOT abort the S2 bootstrapping in response to a changing NodeID. The SIS, inclusion controller and joining node MUST follow the frame flow illustrated in Figure 1. The SIS, inclusion controller and joining node MUST comply with the following steps: 1. Inclusion Controller, C, performs network inclusion of Joining Node, B.   \n2. Inclusion Controller, C, MUST send Inclusion Controller Initiate to SIS, A, immediately follow  \ning the network inclusion.   \n3. SIS, A, MUST request a Node Info Frame from Joining Node, B.   \n4. Joining Node, B, MUST respond to SIS, A, with a Node Info Frame Option 1: If Joining Node B supports S2: 1. SIS, A, MUST start the Security 2 bootstrapping as described in Security 2 (S2) Command Class, version 1, including user dialogs. 2. Joining Node, B, MUST accept being S2 bootstrapped by the SIS Option 2: If Joining Node, B does not support S2 and supports S0 7. If SIS, A wants S0 bootstrapping performed for Joining Node, B, it will send an Inclusion Controller Initiate(S0_INCLUSION) to Inclusion Controller, C   \n8. Inclusion Controller, C MUST perform S0 bootstrapping if it has the S0 network key after receiving Inclusion Controller Initiate(S0_INCLUSION)   \n9. Inclusion Controller, C MUST return an Inclusion Controller Complete to SIS, A to indicate if S0 bootstrapping attempt took place and if it was successful. Following the Security bootstrapping, regardless whether it failed, successful or was not applicable: 10. SIS, A, SHOULD perform any probing needed of the Joining Node, B.   \n11. SIS, A, MUST send an Inclusion Controller Complete Command to the Inclusion Controller, C.   \n12. Inclusion Controller, C, SHOULD perform any probing needed of the Joining Node, B. ",

The Security 2 Command Class provides backwards compatibility to nodes implementing the Security 0 Command Class. Security 2 Command Class also defines a new encapsulation format, new Security Classes and a new KEX Scheme 1, which together offers a number of advantages over the Security 0 Command Class. Security 2 Command Class is scalable and allows more KEX Schemes, Security Classes and encapsulation formats to be introduced in the future if necessary. Communication may be protected for a number of purposes. Known as CIA, the three main areas addressed by communications security are Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity. Confidentiality ensures that only the recipient can decode the communication. Integrity ensures that the recipient can determine if the communication has been modified or replayed. Authentication ensures that the communication really comes from the advertised sender. Security 2 provides Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication through: • Key Exchange, that allows distribution of Network Keys in a Secure Network while preventing interception through: – Out-of-Band verification – Narrow time windows – Physical Activation • Secure Message Encapsulation between nodes that have a shared network key. – A Pre-Agreed Nonce (PAN) is used to prevent Replay Attacks where communication is recorded and played back later, e.g. to unlock a door. In S2 a Nonce is exchanged once and then used to compute subsequent Singlecast PANs (SPAN) and Multicast PANs (MPAN), respectively. – Secure Singlecast communication, supports one-frame secure messages; allowing for lower latency and faster response times. – Secure Multicast communication, allows a sending node to simultaneously send secure messages to multiple nodes. – Cryptographic algorithms are intimately dependent on a perfect Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). The PRNG is seeded with a unique noise pattern to ensure a unique starting point in the long sequence of random numbers generated by the PRNG.

Security 2 encryption MUST be used when transmitting this command. Transport Service segmentation MUST be used if the command is longer than the available payload length of a single Z-Wave MAC frame. This command MUST NOT advertise command classes that the joining node can control in other nodes. Network management user interfaces SHOULD discover control capabilities of a node via the Association Group Information (AGI) Command Class. As per Section 4.2.6.6, a node may be assigned up to four keys for the S2 Unauthenticated, S2 Authenticated, S2 Access Control and S0 Classes, respectively. For instance, a light dimmer may accept non-securely transmitted commands if it is not S2 bootstrapped, while the same dimmer will require secure communication for commands if it is S2 bootstrapped. This allows a Security 2 enabled light dimmer to be compatible with first-generation non-secure Z-Wave networks while it will operate fully secure when included in a S2 network at a later time. In another example, a door lock may be designed to work only with the S0 network key or the S2 Access Control Class key. Inclusion in a network without security bootstrapping will not allow operation of the lock and if bootstrapped with the S2 Access Control Class, S0 encrypted commands will also be ignored. The Security 0 and Security 2 Command Class MUST NOT be advertised in this command The Transport Service Command Class MUST NOT be advertised in this command.

A receiving node MUST stop parsing the list of supported command classes if it detects the COMMAND_CLASS_MARK command class identifier in the Security 2 Commands Supported Report.

An extended Command Class identifier MUST be two bytes long where the first byte is in the range (0xF1-0xFF), while the second byte is in the range 0x00-0xFF.
